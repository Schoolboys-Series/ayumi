Hello everyone, thank you for reading contribution guidelines.

As you know, this project is not only belongs to me, of course codes are belong to me, but resources, such as images and sounds are not. This repository only contains codes, which means if you want to run the game, you need to have resource files, which should ask me to send to you with a signing of confidentiality agreement from you first.

For anyone who wants to do translate, I'm very appreciate and waiting for your pull requests. For who wants to improve code quality, I hope you can test the game before create pull request. Thank you.
