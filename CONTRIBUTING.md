Hello everyone, thank you for reading contribution guidelines.

As you know, this project is not only belongs to me, of course codes are belong to me, but resources, such as images and sounds are not. This repository only contains codes, which means if you want to run the game, you need to have resource files, which should ask me to send to you with a signing of confidentiality agreement from you first.

If you want to join or have the resource file, please create at least one pull request with reasonable code changes or translated sentences then send the confidentiality aggreement to me by email (l.gholoi@outlook.com). Once I merged your pull request, I'll send resource pack's address to you.
