#### For translator pack user

Ask resoruce files from me and extract to the respository folder directly, it will provide you a runnable game for debugging. I need you to sign and send confidentiality agreement (can find in this repository, called _confidentiality_agreement.psd) before send files to you, this is a forced condition in purpose to keep original creaters' copyright on 2eme Gymnop√©die.
